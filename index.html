<h1>Howdy</h1>

<p>I'm Joe. I created this page because I've had complaints that my online presence is awful, apologies.</p>

<p>I'm the developer behind <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3122220/Mr_Figs">Mr Figs</a>. A topdown action puzzley kinda game.</p>

Here's a dated teaser:

<p>I also do a buttload of music stuff and that's probably why you're here.</p>

<p>I wouldn't bother reading what's here, it's very old.</p>
