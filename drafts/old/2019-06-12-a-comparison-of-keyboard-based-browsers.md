## Qutebrowser

### Pros

- Has the most featureful vim mode I've seen

### Cons

- Installation process is long winded on linux. See this page to see what I mean https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/install.asciidoc

### Vimb

### Pros

- Easy installation (If you git clone, I had trouble using a zip as it seems it
  relies on git)

### Cons

- No tabs
