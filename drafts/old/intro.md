Before I dive right in, I'll explain briefly what I've chosen and why.

## Which Lisp

I'll be using Scheme, mostly due to its minimal nature. Along with this, I've chosen to (try) and stick to R5RS for the time being. Again, this is due to the minimal nature and its focus on education more than production. I'm looking to learn, not create software solutions.

## Equipment

I'll be going with the DrRacket IDE since it has everything I need out of the box and has support for multiple kinds of Scheme should I change my mind. Once I get a bit more comfortable and familiar with Scheme I may just use Vim and a compiler.

## The approach

I'll be aiming to complete one challenge a week from [/r/dailyprogrammer](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer). I'll start with the easy challenges at the start of my quest and gradually make my way to the intermediate and hard challenges. I'll post my solution to the challenge and some ramblings on what I thought of it, what could be improved etc...

I also aim to have a project to work on either alongside the challenges or replacing them so that I get some actual experience of creating things.
The project will probably something to do with one of the following

- Digital Signal Processing
- Data Science
- A web framework

We'll see...

## The resources

I'll mostly be looking at books and blogs. In particular
[TSPL (3rd edition as the newest edition focuses on R6RS)](http://www.scheme.com/tspl3/)
[HTDP](http://www.htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-1.html#node_toc_start)
