Text: 

I was never content( and am still not content) with the sound of this sketch. 

The sketch itself did not turn out how I perceived inside my head. Generally I stick to the rule that I may not go back to a sketch and re-write it to make it sound better. As such, so there was no alteration to this sketch.


The part that does please me about this sketch is the rhythmic variation of the lead guitar, whilst in my head it was meant to be much more dramatic, I felt I still managed to convey the rhythm appropriately.


Not all sketches seem to go the way you want them, just try and do better next time.
