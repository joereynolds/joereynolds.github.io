Sketch 2 is a fairly simple sketch, it is a I - V progression in A harmonic minor with notes from the byzantine scale thrown in.

The byzantine scale is quite a rare scale to be heard and is often a good alternative to the harmonic minor scale if you are looking for an eastern-european sound.

The scale's formula is as follows:

1--b2--3--4--5--b6--7

The interesting part to note with this scale is the chromaticism from the 7th degree to the b2:
7--1--b2

I employed this chromaticism during the V chord (In this case the E) and it helped break away from the monotony of a standard harmonic minor scale.

Generally I find the harmonic minor scale extremely cliche'd but incorporating other scales seemed to add a bit more interest to the song and for myself.
