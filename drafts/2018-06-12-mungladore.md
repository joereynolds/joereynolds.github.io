Mungladore is an interactive text processor. It allows you to sort through text in real-time using pipeline style input on the console. It has multiple features including the ability to pipe commands,  aggregate commands against multiple inputs, export results to a .txt file, and more. Curses support is something I intend to add to Mungladore
Below, we are gathering all the words that are greater than 10 characters in length and that begin with 'z'. Then, we are getting the first 2 results.
