# Drop your ego at the door, the user is everything.

Do not sacrifice [usability](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed/issues/284#issuecomment-582015298) for code quality.

Your code is not more important than the [people](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed/issues/213) using it.

[User's](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed/pull/107) don't care about the code that runs their programs.

Am I getting through to [you](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed/issues/174)?

Develop with the user in mind, not with [you(r ego)](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed/pull/193) in mind.

Fine by me.
