This sketch starts off with a motif based around a major second, the idea of this song was to suggest as little (major, or minor) tonality. I could have made it further with this exercise but for the sake of musicality I did decide to add in some characteristics of the minor and major keys they relate to.

If I truly wanted a song without any hint towards the key then I would have to omit the third,seventh and possibly the sixth. This omission could lead to boredom, and given the time constraints I usually give myself for these, it wasn't really possible.

Maybe I'll do more with this...
