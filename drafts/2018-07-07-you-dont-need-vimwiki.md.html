<h1 id="you-probably-dont-need-vimwiki">You (probably) don't need Vimwiki</h1>
<p>Why are you using <a href="https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki">vimwiki</a>?</p>
<p>Probably to make notes, right?</p>
<p>Well did you know that you don't need a plugin for this?</p>
<p>Of course you did!</p>
<p>Let's go through some of Vimwiki's features and dispel them in places of vim alternatives.</p>
<p>Vimwiki states the following features</p>
<h5 id="organise-notes-and-ideas">1. Organise notes and ideas</h5>
<p>Understandable, vimwiki boasts this feature, when I used to use vimwiki, I loved the linking and referencing all over the place, but I have two letters for you; <code>gf</code>.</p>
<p><code>gf</code> allows you to edit the file under the cursor (assuming it's in your path).</p>
<p>With a sensible directory structure, you can easily organise your notes and ideas.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/joereynolds/life">my repo</a> and come back here when you're done.</p>
<p>That repository is just a dumping ground of articles that I may or may not write at some point but the point is, it's entirely navigable with vim.</p>
<p>The directory structure is:</p>
<pre><code>README.md   
docs/
  article-1.md
  article-2.md
  article-3.md
  article-4.md
  index.md</code></pre>
<p><code>index.md</code> is just a table of contents hyperlinking to all other articles and looks like this</p>
<pre><code>- article-1.md - A description of what article-1 is
- article-2.md - A description of what article-2 is
- article-3.md - A description of what article-3 is
- article-4.md - A description of what article-4 is</code></pre>
<h5 id="manage-todo-lists">2. Manage todo lists</h5>
<h5 id="write-documentation">3. Write documentation</h5>
<p>There are two thoughts that go through my mind with this one:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You can easily write documentation in any editor, I'm not sure what vimwiki brings to the table here (TODO find out) but it's possible'</p></li>
<li><p>I would prefer something built for this purpose such as <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">readthedocs</a></p></li>
</ol>
<h5 id="maintain-a-diary">Maintain a diary</h5>
<p>Ok, vimwiki wins here, I have no idea how you'd do this without too many lines of vimscript.</p>
<h5 id="export-everything-to-html">Export everything to HTML</h5>
<p>Again, two points here:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The entire point of markdown is that it's easily editable and readable just as is, write your notes in markdown and you won't even need to render it to HTML.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to render stuff to HTML, just use <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> it's entire purpose is converting files from one format to another and will do what you need here.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A mapping to convert the current markdown file to HTML could look like</p>
<p><code>nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;r :!pandoc % --to=html5 &gt; %.html</code></p>
