Behold the powers of the shell!
I feel like most newcomers to programming probably don't realise the full potential of the shell. Hopefully I can change their minds with a few nifty tings!

Follow along as we explore some Unix wizardry (spare pair of underwear advised).

####Find a Function Definition
```
grep -lr "function addOne" *.php
```
Searches all .php files in your current directory for the line 'function addOne'.

####Find All Distinct File Extensions
```
find . -type f | perl -ne 'print $1 if m/\.([^.\/]+)$/' |sort -u
```
Example output
```
doc
gif
html
etc...
```
####Find Files Whose Modification Date is 50 Or More Days Ago
```
find . -mtime +50
```
