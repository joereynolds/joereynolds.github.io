# \#1 
![pure data patch 1](https://i.imgur.com/0oPXAt8.jpg)

My first Pure Data patch.

I've started experimenting with it as a way of subduing my urge for modular
synthesizers.

It doesn't sound great but there's definitely something juicy lurking in the trenches.
- 2 oscillators (osc~) going off at 2 separate times (metro 1000, metro 120) at random frequencies (random 880, random 2000) 
- Constant white noise (noise~). 
- Output of the oscillators is pumped into a graph for all to see (tabwrite~ output). 

My next patch will sound nicer.
