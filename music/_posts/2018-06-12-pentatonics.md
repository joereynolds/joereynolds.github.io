A pentatonic scale is a scale that consists of 5 notes. 

Sometimes the omission of notes actually yields more interest than the addition of more notes and this is where pentatonic scales come into their own.

The 2 most common types of pentatonic are the:

#### Minor Pentatonic

A  | C  | D    | E     | G
---|----|-----|------|--
1|  b3 | 4   | 5   | b7

#### Major Pentatonic

A  | B  | C#    | E     | F#
---|----|-----|------|--
1|  2 | 3   | 5   | 6

There is also a popular variant dubbed the:

#### Blues Scale

A  | C  | D    | Eb   | E | G
---|----|-----|------|---|--
1|  b3 | 4   | b5   | 5 | b7

(The above Blues Scale is just a minor pentatonic with an added b5.)


There are other lesser known pentatonic scales apart from the above. First off, we could get a great deal more variation out of each pentatonic by thinking modally and starting the scale on a different root to imply a different mode.


We know that:

A minor pentatonic is:

`A C D E G`.

If we start this same scale on C, we get:

`C D E G A`.

Now we break this down and see how the intervals relate to C.

C  | D  | E    | G     | A
---|----|-----|------|--
1|  2 | 3   | 5   | 6

It's not the most interesting example. This is just the major pentatonic scale.

Let's try a more lesser known example to get us used to the idea.

If we start on G:

`G A C D E`

`1 2 4 5 6`


We get a scale that is suitable for not only major playing but also suits the Dorian mode as well. It's useful to study the formulas of each scale and get a thorough knowledge of them, as this topic crops up extremely often.

Being able to understand what scale works with what key is absolutely necessary for music and I have written an article explaining all of this here.


## Other scales

Okay, now that we have exhausted the basic pentatonics, it is time to consider completely different scales.

One of the most interesting pentatonic scales I have come across, is the Indian pentatonic.

The Indian pentatonic scale in A is:

A  | C#  | D    | E     | G
---|----|-----|------|--
1|  3 | 4   | 5   | b7

Anytime you see a formula like the above, you should be thinking what it can go against. We can see that this could work against a major backing but equally, we should notice the b7 at the end of the scale which hints at a dominant sound.

If we carry out the logic that we did at the beginning of this article and start this scale on a different note, we can get even more interesting ideas.

C#  | D  | E    | G     | A
---|----|-----|------|--
1|  b2 | b3   | b5   | 6

This is a much more extreme example and resembles something close to the 2nd mode of the harmonic minor scale, Locrian natural 6th.

There are many pentatonic scales around and I can't cover them all but hopefully the above example has whetted your appetite and made you understand the merit of omitting notes.

## Superimposing the pentatonic scale

There are other less obvious ways to get more mileage out of pentatonic scales aside from just playing the scale over a static backing. For instance, if we consider the concept of [superimposition](/2018/06/12/superimposition.html), then we can see many other possibilities for just this one scale.

A very quick way to see the merits of such a scale is to consider it against a backing of all 12 keys.

If we take A minor for example and cycle through all 12 keys, we get the following intervals in relation to the key. (I've left some keys out for the sake of space+time)


A Minor pentatonic
	
`A C D E G `

Over A
	
`1 b3 4 5 b7`

Over B
	
b7 b2 b3 4 b6

Over D
	
`5 b7 1 2 4`

Over F
	
`3 5 6 7 2`

Over E	

`4 b6 b7 1 b3`

It would also be necessary to consider the major pentatonic against backings as this seems to be a much underappreciated scale in western music.

A Major pentatonic
	
 A B C# E F#
	
Over A
	
`1 2 3 5 6`
	
 
Over B
	
`b7 1 2 4 5`

Over D	

`5 6 7 2 3`

It's up to you to determine what you think is a suitable imposition. Just by looking at the above we can see that A minor over an F backing would yield a major sound due to the lack of flat tones whereas if we were to play the exact same scale but over a B backing, the effect would be the complete opposite. We would then be implying the `b7 b2 b3 b6` and `4` of `B` which is essentially the Phrygian mode.

This can be taken in many different ways and for further reading on pentatonics I would recommend listening to traditional Japanese and Chinese music, these two tend to utilise these scales to a greater degree and with more variety than in western music.
