Title: BeautifulSoup

Text: 

If you're for some reason averse to Js or jQuery, or have a strong interest in web-scraping with Python, then you'll probably find yourself using BeautifulSoup pretty soon.

Let's dig straight in with some examples. I'll try and stick to an easy-difficult ordering so it's easy to read from top to bottom. 

**Note:** Some knowledge of CSS and HTML is immensely helpful when scraping the web!

#### Reading the URL's content
```
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import urllib.request

url  = 'http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pokemon'
url_html =  urllib.request.urlopen(url).read().decode('utf-8')
soup = BeautifulSoup(url_html)
```

####Finding all links on a page
```
links = soup.find_all('a')
```

####Getting a specific attribute of an HTML element
```
links = soup.find_all('a')

for link in links:
    title = str(link.get('title'))
```
####View all attributes of an element
```
tables = soup.find_all('table')

for table in tables:
    print(table.attrs)
```
