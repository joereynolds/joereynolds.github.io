Building a MIDI Parser (part 4)

Why are we building this?

Yep. That's a question I asked myself before I started working on the parser. If you didn't know what we can use the parser for, it has very little point. Okay so it can retrieve a time signature and comments, so what?


Exactly.


So what is the point of the parser?

The parser works best on scraping info on a large amount of files. Here are a few ideas to get you started.


    Find the most common key of x amount of songs.
    Find the least common key of x amount of songs.
    Find a correlation between tempo and genre of music (are most rock songs faster?)


Put these into a nice graph with matplotlib or R and you have yourself some actual use.
