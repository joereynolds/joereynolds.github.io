Title: Sketch 1

----

Text: 

This was the first sketch I wrote and so was a bit unsure of the results.

The song itself is in D harmonic major and was my first real experience with this scale. I tried to stick exclusively to the harmonic major scale so as not to blur the traits of this odd scale.

The most difficult part was finding a suitable underlying harmony. In hindsight I should have worked out all the chords that are able to be constructed from this scale but for this time I just used my ears and hoped for the best.
