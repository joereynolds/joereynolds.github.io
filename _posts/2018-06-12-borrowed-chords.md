A borrowed chord is a chord that is 'borrowed' from the parallel key. Meaning, if we are composing a song in C major, then we would borrow chords from C minor. There's a few rules you can follow as you learn.

For example:

- It is more common for a major key to borrow from a minor key as a minor key already has lots of variation due to the many different types of minor (Melodic, Natural and Harmonic).

- If a minor key were to borrow from a major key, it would not have much (if anything) to gain.

Below are the three common minor scales and their accompanying chords;

Key:

`m` = Minor, `M` = Major, `o` = Diminished, `+` = Augmented

#### Natural

A  | B  | C    | D     | E     | F       | G
---|----|-----|------|------|------|--
m|  o   | M   | m   | m     | M    |M

#### Melodic

A  | B  | C    | D     | E     | F#       | G#
---|----|-----|------|------|------|--
m|  M   | +   | M   | M     | o    |o

#### Harmonic

A  | B  | C    | D     | E     | F       | G#
---|----|-----|------|------|------|--
m|  o   | +   | m   | M     | M    |o

It should be noted that the most common borrowed chords from the minor key are:

`ii` - The diminished chord

`iv` - The minor chord

`bvi` - The major chord

This does not mean that you shouldn't try other combinations like incorporating the augmented chord on the `III` of the harmonic minor scale or the two diminished chords at `VI` and `VII` of the melodic minor. 

Food for thought: Borrowing chords can lead to an easier and smoother way to modulate to a different key.
