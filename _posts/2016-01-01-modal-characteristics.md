Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian and more are all modes. But what makes each mode
different? It's their intervallic nature. 

For instance, you might find it hard to grasp how C major could be both C major
and A minor. Well, long story short it's because the order of their intervals
change and so too does the sound.

In order for us to emphasise what mode we are in, we need to emphasise the
character tones of that mode.

A character tone is basically the one note that 'defines' that mode (Lydian has
#4, Locrian has b5 etc...). I'll summarise the modes below, placing a '*' by the
important interval of that mode: -
 
#### Modes

Dorian      | 1 | 2   | b3 | 4   |  5  | 6* | b7
Phrygian    | 1 | b2* | b3 | 4   |  5  | b6 | b7    
Lydian      | 1 | 2   | 3  | #4* |  5  | 6  | 7    
Mixolydian  | 1 | 2   | 3  | 4   |  5  | 6  |  b7*    
Locrian     | 1 | b2  | b3 | 4   | b5* | b6 |  b7    
     

Note the exclusion of the Ionian (Major scale) and Aeolian (Minor scale) modes.
These are the major and natural minor scale and don't need to be present.

So then, from the above, we can gather the most 'characteristic' tone of each
mode. Let's use the phrygian mode for the rest of our example.

## Phrygian

If we were to begin writing melody or harmony (or both) then we should
consciously try and incorporate the b2 (Phrygian's character tone), if we do not
incorporate this interval often, you will find the progression/melody gradually
slipping back into the respective minor/major scale it is in.

So how do we impose modes onto the listener?
 
Let's say we are writing a harmonic backdrop for a melody, we are on an entirely
blank canvas and we need to emphasise the b2 (Since we're trying to imply
Phrygian).

 
A few options would be:

- To play a chord that features the b2

- To feature the b2 in any other chord we play.

Playing the chord on the b2 is an easy one, in the case of E phrygian we would
just play F major.

The second option, whilst more difficult to do straight away, provides us with
much variation.

The name of a chord that features the character tone in the chord itself is
known as a primary chord(The root chord is also a primary chord).

Therefore, in E Phrygian, the following are all primary chords:


#### E minor 
This is the root chord.

#### F major  
This chord is built off of the b2 and is immediately recognised as 'phrygian'.

#### D minor 
This chord is the vii of E phrygian and contains the b2 also.

So, to emphasise the Phrygian mode, we could perhaps have a harmonic progression  such as;

ii  | vii  | i    

Each of these chords contains the b2.

Any chord that does not contain the b2 is known as a 'secondary' chord.

Through process of elimination, we can see that the secondary chords of E
phrygian are:

- Gmajor

- Aminor

- Bm7b5

- Cmajor
 
Whilst they do not possess the phrygian 'flavour' they can still be treated as
passing chords and incorporated into a composition.

Melody wise, incorporating modal characteristics isn't difficult. We
just have to adhere to the mode we are in, we should be doing this anyway.
