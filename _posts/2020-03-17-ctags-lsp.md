# Tags and LSPs where do I start?

## Introduction

With the introduction of the **L**anguage **S**erver **P**rotocol (referenced
as LSPs from here on in), there's increasing confusion over what they offer and
if people still need tags.

It gets even more confusing for a beginner who is getting their feet wet with
text editors and is suddenly given the recommendation to download
`universal-ctags`, `gutentags`, `coc` and the LSP client of their choice. I'm
not surprised people are confused so let's go over what's what and clear some
things up...

## What are tags?

Tags are a way of managing function definitions, references, declarations and
the other expected code navigation niceties that you see in typical code editing
programs. They can help you reason about your code and answer questions you may
have such as:

*Where is this function defined?*

*Where is this function used?*

*Where is this variable declared?*

## How do I create tags?

Tags are usually stored in a file and can be created by a program that generates
tags. The most popular and widely used is `universal-ctags` better known as
'ctags'. 

### What's ctags?

ctags is a program to generate a tags file, that's it! I'd recommend using
`universal-ctags`, not `exuberant-ctags` since it's actively maintained. 

If you want an easier installation process, you can use `exuberant-ctags` just
by doing `sudo apt install ctags`. As far as I know, you have to compile
`universal-ctags` yourself.

### Great, what are things like Global?

Global (or GNU Global) is another source code tagging system similar to ctags.
There are a few differences but the biggest one that got me using it in the
first place was that it could find *references* in code. As far as I'm aware,
ctags is not capable of this.

There are many different source code indexing systems, as a catch-all,
universal-ctags is a safe bet. Research others if you feel you're missing
something.

### Do I have to pick one or the other?

Nope. Back in the day before LSPs came around I had a bastardised config that
consisted of both GNU Global and universal-ctags. I used GNU Global everywhere
that I could (I found it more reliable) and fell back to universal-ctags when
necessary.

(There's a vim plugin bundled with GNU Global that does all this for you)

## And LSPs?

An LSP is an implementation that follows the [language server protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). These
have an advantage over tags file in that they are verifiably correct, as they
actually parse the code you're working with instead of relying on regular
expressions and string matching.

Generally speaking, they are more reliable than a tags system.

## What does an LSP do?

An LSP is capable of correctly answering questions such as:

*Where is this method used?*

*Format this text selection for me*

*Rename this method across the codebase*

*Find where this variable is declared*

An LSP is **not** just about code navigation. It offers code refactoring,
formatting, documentation and more.

## Okay, I still need you to explain LSPs...

With an LSP, every language you use in your code will have a language server
(and client). You can see a reputable list [here](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/servers/)

If you want to use LSPs in vim (or any other editor), then you will need to find
a way of supporting the LSP and the language server you're using.

As a real world example:

I work with PHP everyday and I use LSPs. I use [coc](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) (who doesn't) as my method of talking to language servers and then I use [coc-phpls](https://github.com/marlonfan/coc-phpls/) as my language server for PHP.

That's it! There is no configuration on my side needed for this apart from a few
mappings:

```
nmap ]r <Plug>(coc-references)
nmap ]d <Plug>(coc-definition)
vmap ]f <Plug>(coc-format-selected)
```

Once that is done, I get intelligent completion all the way down. It does not
choke or get lost on abstract classes or interfaces and has not once struggled
to resolve a class no matter how deep the class hierarchy.

If you want to add another language server, you just find the implementation and
install it. For example `coc-tsserver` for Typescript.

## But I'm not using Coc...

That's fine. There are lightweight solutions out there or you can
literally query the language server yourself (it's a lot of work and I wouldn't
recommend it unless you want to learn about LSPs);

For Neovim users, there is now a built-in LSP and configurations for popular
language servers can be found [here](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lsp) (I
will be moving to this shortly, I don't like selling my soul to coc).

## Okay, I think I get it! Should I choose tags or an LSP?

As always and irritatingly, the answer is "it depends". However, in my own
opinion, I will say to use LSPs and then smatter some tags on top if you need
it.

# FAQ

## Is there any reason to use tags if I'm using an LSP?

For the most part no, however I've come across some edge-cases where a tags
system actually works better than an LSP.

Take the following example:

```
$mockCustomer = $this->createMock(Customer::class);
$mockCustomer
    ->method('loadById')
    ->willReturn(new Customer());
```

For those that don't know much about testing or PHP, this is creating a mock
object which will override the default `loadById` behaviour of the `Customer`
object. Now the thing is, if I change the name of my `loadById` method in the
`Customer` class itself and use an LSP to find all usages and change those too,
it will not pick this string `'loadById'` up. Why? Because it's just a string,
not an actual call to the method. However, when we **do** change the name in the
class, we need to update it here as well as it's coupled to the name of the
method.

In these circumstances, the naivety and simplicity of a tags program comes in
handy.

## What's the difference between Gtags and Ctags? How is Gtags better?

As mentioned previously, there's not a huge difference except GNU Global
(sometimes referred to as Gtags) is able to find references of method usage.

## Can't I just use grep?

You can, and there's nothing wrong with that for a shotgun approach to code
refactoring but if you want more useful/intelligent results to come through, use
a tags system or an LSP.
