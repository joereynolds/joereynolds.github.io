Title: Logical Steps

Logical Steps is a game I have in mind where a user is  greeted with a maze and their character, and must all in one move, say the moves required to get to the next level. It's not designed to be good, just frustrating ( :3 )

##How it works

The user presses a direction (up, down, left, or right) and the player will move in that direction until it hits a solid object.

The user needs to press **all** of their moves in a sequence and then press *enter* to confirm their movement sequence.

For example

If a level is laid out like so:

(Not an actual image of gameplay or indicative of what It may look like)

The user would have to press the keys

'up', 'right','up','right'
